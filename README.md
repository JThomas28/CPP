This Project serves as a virtual donut shop.
It reads from an input file containing multiple lines with 2 numbers.

The first number is the donut order number
The second number is the number of donuts

It is a multithreaded program, so there is one thread acting as the waiter (taking in the order input) and the second thread acts as the baker (making sure each mox has 12 donuts)
In the end, the program outputs, to the console, the number of donuts made, the number of boxes neaded, and the number of orders filled.
